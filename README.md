# Talk-with-MySQL-Databae-with-Lang-Chain
we'll explore how to set up a chat interface with a MySQL database using Python and LangChain. We'll create a LangChain chain that enables natural language interaction with the database and utilizes the LangChain wrapper of SQLAlchemy for database interaction.
## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to set up a chat interface with a MySQL database using Python and LangChain. We'll create a LangChain chain that enables natural language interaction with the database and utilizes the LangChain wrapper of SQLAlchemy for database interaction.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9 or later
- MySQL
- SQLite

## Setting Up the Test Database

In this section, we'll set up the [Chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) database. This is a sample database that represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. We will use this database to test our chatbot.
For easy access, you can download the latest SQL file from this [link](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/releases/download/v1.4.5/Chinook_MySql.sql).

### Install the Required Python Libraries

Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
```python 
pip install langchain mysql-connector-python
```
